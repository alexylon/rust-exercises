// lifetime specifier as the b argument, meaning that it should live less than it, as it borrows
// the same object. The reference in the type of the c argument is not annotated, as the
// object it refers is not borrowed by any reference in the return value.

// This generic function has two lifetime parameters, and also two type parameters.
// The lifetime parameter a specifies that the third field of the return value borrows the
// object already borrowed by the b argument, while the lifetime parameter b specifies that
// the first field of the return value borrows the object already borrowed by the second field
// of the c argument. Moreover, the function has two type parameters, T1 and T2, used as
// usual.
